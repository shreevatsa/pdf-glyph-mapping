# This is the mapping from each glyph id to the sequence of Unicode codepoints that it represents.
#
# Explanation:
#
# A font contains "glyphs" (roughly: pictures/shapes, of letters/letter-parts/letter-combinations).
# Consider an example from https://itextpdf.com/sites/default/files/2018-12/PP_Advanced_typography_in_PDF-compressed.pdf#page=36 —
# In some font (Noto Sans Devanagari), the word वर्णों may be typeset using three glyphs:
# 1. Glyph id  57 (0x0039): A glyph for the shape of the letter व
# 2. Glyph id  39 (0x0027): A glyph for the shape of the letter ण
# 3. Glyph id 452 (0x01C4): A glyph for the remaining shapes (indicating the half-ra, the vowel-sign o, and anusvara).
#
# In Unicode though, the word वर्णों is represented as a different sequence of codepoints (Unicode scalar values):
#
#         0935 DEVANAGARI LETTER VA
#         0930 DEVANAGARI LETTER RA
#         094D DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA
#         0923 DEVANAGARI LETTER NNA
#         094B DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN O
#         0902 DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA
#
# Roughly, the glyph sequence matches the *visual* order, while the Unicode sequence matches the *phonetic* order.
#
# The mapping from glyph id to Unicode is what this file encodes.
#
# For the above example, the meanings of the three glyphs above may be encoded in this file as:
#
#         [0039]
#         replacement_text = "व"
#         replacement_codes = [ 2357,]  # Same as [0x0935]
#         replacement_desc = [ "0935 DEVANAGARI LETTER VA",]
#
#         [0027]
#         replacement_text = "ण"
#         replacement_codes = [ 2339,] # Same as [0x0923]
#         replacement_desc = [ "0923 DEVANAGARI LETTER NNA",]
#
#         [01C4]
#         replacement_text = "र्<CCprec>ों"
#         replacement_codes = [ 2352, 2381, -1, 2379, 2306,] # Same as [0x0930, 0x094D, -1, 0x094B, 0x0902]
#         replacement_desc = [ "0930 DEVANAGARI LETTER RA", "094D DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA", "<CCprec>", "094B DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN O", "0902 DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA",]
#
# where you could write just one of `replacement_text`, `replacement_codes`, `replacement_desc`, or even just:
#
#         0039 = [0x0935]
#         0027 = [0x0923]
#         01C4 = [0x0930, 0x094D, -1, 0x094B, 0x0902]
#
# In general, the convention of this toml file is that it is a table where:
#
# -   key is a string of 4 hex digits (like `0039` above), and
# -   value is either
#
#     -   an integer sequence (like `[0x0930, 0x094D, -1, 0x094B, 0x0902]` above),
#     -   a table that maps some subset of:
#         -   "replacement_text" to a Unicode string,
#         -   "replacement_codes" to a list of integers,
#         -   "replacement_desc" to a list of strings,
#
#     with the special conventions that:
#         -   (Usually following र् ) "<CCprec>" in replacement_text and replacement_desc, or -1 in replacement_codes, means that
#             everything so far must go *before* the previous consonant cluster, and
#         -   (Usually following  ि ) "<CCsucc>" in replacement_text and replacement_desc, or 1 in replacement_codes, means that
#             everything so far must go *after* the next consonant cluster
#
#     where "consonant cluster" means ([क-ह]्)*[क-ह] i.e. a (possibly empty) sequence of (consonant + virama), followed by a consonant.
